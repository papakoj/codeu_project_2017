To properly run the GUI client, you have to run the server at port 2007
e.g. ./run_server.sh 100 ABABAB 2007 ./
To simplify testing I had the GUI client always connect to that port.

I am getting a NullPointerException in the tests I created (ModelTest).
However, this is occurring after all my relevant code has run, 
and I cannot find a reason as to why it's occurring.

RawControllerTest is having errors when testing AddConversation and AddUser
however I did not edit the Controller class and cannot currently figure out 
why this is happening.
